## PROJECT TYPES

### Data Analysis (Python, R, ...)
Anything that is an (.ipynb) file. _Note: more recent projects aren't mine to show off here (proprietary data), but I can discuss them in terms of procedure, scope, and impact._
+ `data_hdi_project_TESTS`  
I took data from the United Nations Development Program and replicated some visualizations from their website in Python. I would be interested in re-doing the visuals with Plot.ly rather than matplotlib.
+ `data_sentiment-analysis_soup`  
Our course tutorial learning how to use the python library `beautiful_soup` for basic NLP and text manipulation, including removing punctuation, filler words, and custom dictionaries.

### Presentations (Generally PPTX -> PDF)
+ `un_presentation`  
Mock-up presentation that discusses the UNDP (from a contemporary technical standpoint, nothing from Vijay Prashad's histories of the UN sadly).

### Website (HTML, OctoberCMS, ...)
+ I created (both site and content) for the GeoTechnical Women Faculty Project at Syracuse University: [GTWF site](http://gtwf.syr.edu)
+ I run my own website, which is a lesson in not learning PHP by first implementing it on production.

### Databases
+ Created customized database and corresponding "office BlueBook" for a university in Washington, D.C. that collected a decade of historical data from across departments and generated projections for the future
    + Resulted in 200-pages of documentation
    + Thousands of unique entries



### Linux Systems
Not exactly an easy to show off skill, but I grew up using Linux and in the fall of 2014 taught myself bash scripting (as I was waiting to being university in Seattle). Since then, I've continued to learn more about GNU/Linux systems. Currently on a derivative of Arch linux, btw

+ Comfortable with bash scripts, Linux networking, system maintenance and the advanced Linux kernel (see my LinkedIn)
