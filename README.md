## PROJECT TYPES

### Writing (Technical & Non)
As a graduate of the Humanities, the language arts will forever be close to my heart. As someone with a hobby in tech, and jobs spanning various tech-affiliated areas, my writing currently tends more towards the Technical (i.e. informative) rather than expository (i.e. argumentative) form.

Note that, as a lot of my actual technical writing is produced for _internal_ use, I cannot provide full examples here for many projects. I am able to send excerpted segments in "password-protected" form upon request. (See `cumberland_writing_sample_2018.128.pdf` and `cumberland_writing_sample_2021.128.pdf` for example.) There is NO sensitive, proprietary, or personal information included in either document.

That said, I do have a number of publicly available publications:
* [Seed Grants of Change: Building Thriving Networks Among Female Geotechnical Faculty](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29EI.2643-9115.0000039) was published in 2021 in _The Journal of Civil Engineering Education_. 
* Another paper ("State of the Field: Changing Geotechnical Faculty Demographics and Recognition") has been accepted for publication at [GeoCongress 2022](https://www.geocongress.org/), that will be linked here when it is published [Available upon request]
* My undergraduate thesis is here `cumberland_undergrad_thesis_2016.pdf` as well, on the subject of Japanese colonialism in the post-Meiji era.

### Data Analysis (Python, R, ...)
Anything that is an (.ipynb) file. _Note: more recent projects aren't mine to show off here (proprietary data), but I can discuss them in terms of procedure, scope, and impact._
+ `data_hdi_project_TESTS`  
I took data from the United Nations Development Program and replicated some visualizations from their website in Python. I would be interested in re-doing the visuals with Plot.ly rather than matplotlib.
+ `data_sentiment-analysis_soup`  
Our course tutorial learning how to use the python library `beautiful_soup` for basic NLP and text manipulation, including removing punctuation, filler words, and custom dictionaries.

### Presentations (Generally PPTX -> PDF)
+ `un_presentation`  
Mock-up presentation that discusses the UNDP (from a contemporary technical standpoint, nothing from Vijay Prashad's histories of the UN sadly).

### Website (HTML, OctoberCMS, ...)
+ I created (both site and content) for the GeoTechnical Women Faculty Project at Syracuse University: [GTWF site](http://gtwf.syr.edu)
+ I run my own website, which is a lesson in not learning PHP by first implementing it on production.

### Databases
+ Created customized database and corresponding "office BlueBook" for a university in Washington, D.C. that collected a decade of historical data from across departments and generated projections for the future
    + Resulted in 200-pages of documentation
    + Thousands of unique entries


### Linux Systems
Not exactly an easy to show off skill, but I grew up using Linux and in the fall of 2014 taught myself bash scripting (as I was waiting to being university in Seattle). Since then, I've continued to learn more about GNU/Linux systems. Currently on a derivative of Arch linux, btw

+ Comfortable with bash scripts, Linux networking, system maintenance and the advanced Linux kernel (see my LinkedIn)

I am currently pursuing Linux System Administration Certification, a bold move for what has until now been merely a rewarding (and geeky!) hobby.
